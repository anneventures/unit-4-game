# What the project does
<p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game. You win the game by matching your total score to random number; you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.</p>
<p>There are four crystals, and by clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. Note that the value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.</p>
